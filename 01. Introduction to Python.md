# Python Tutorial
Python is an **object-oriented programming** language, originally written in the **C language**.
Learning and teaching Python is **remarkably easy**, and it can serve as a strong foundation for understanding and learning other programming languages.
For anyone who is new to programming, Python is one of the best choices to begin with.
Because Python is highly versatile and used across many different fields, **learning it can open up a wide range of job opportunities**.

## Features of Python
1. **Very close to human language**:
Python is designed to be readable and intuitive. Even people without programming knowledge can often understand Python code.

2. **Readable by beginners**:
Its clean and simple syntax allows anyone with or without prior experience to follow the logic of the program.

3. **Rich set of libraries**:
Python includes a vast collection of libraries for tasks such as **string manipulation**, **internet operations**, **web service tools**, operating system interfaces, and various protocols.
These libraries ensure that **you don’t need to write everything from scratch**; you can **reuse existing**, well-tested code.

Python is ideal for extracting data from websites using libraries like **BeautifulSoup, Scrapy, and Selenium**.

9. **Internet of Things (IoT)**:
Python is used in IoT devices and embedded systems, enabling developers to control sensors, devices, and connected systems.

# Learning the Python Programming Language
Just like any human language such as Persian or English, Python also **uses symbols**, including **letters (a–z)**, **digits**, and** characters like `{}, (), /`, and others.

In the same way that every language has its own vocabulary (for example, “water,” “father,” etc.), **Python also has its own set of keywords**, such as **if, else, while**, and many more.

Just as human languages have grammar rules that define how words come together to form meaningful sentences (such as the placement of subject, verb, and object), **programming languages also have their own structural rules**. These rules determine how code must be written so the computer can understand and execute it correctly.

## Keywords in Python
Keywords are words that cannot be used as identifiers, such as **variable names** or **function names**. In Python, **keywords are case-sensitive**. For example, Variable and variable are not the same. This means you cannot write a keyword in uppercase if it is defined in lowercase, or vice versa; doing so will cause an error in your program.

**Python has 35 keywords**, although this number may change gradually over time. In Python, **all keywords are written in lowercase, except for False, True, and None**. They must be written exactly as they are.

```python
import keyword
print(keyword.kwlist)

False      await      else       import     pass
None       break      except     in         raise
True       class      finally    is         return
and        continue   for        lambda     try
as         def        from       nonlocal   while
assert     del        global     not        with
async      elif       if         or         yield

```

## Identifiers in Python
Identifiers are **names used** to identify **variables**, **functions**, **classes**, **or other** objects in Python.

1. An identifier can be a **combination of uppercase and lowercase letters and numbers**.
2. Examples of valid identifiers:
   
   ```python
      myVar1
      X2
      my_file_0
   ```

3. An identifier **cannot start with a number**. For example:

   ```python
      1variable  # ❌ Invalid
      variable1  # ✅ Valid
   ```

4. Keywords cannot be used as identifiers. For example:

   ```python
      else = 1  # ❌ Invalid
   ```

5. Special symbols such as `!, @, #, $, %`, and others **cannot be used in identifiers**.
6. Identifiers are **case-sensitive**, so `myVar` and `myvar` are **considered different**.
7. When choosing identifiers, it’s important to **pick meaningful names**. While `c = 10` is valid, writing `count = 10` is more meaningful and clearly shows what the variable represents. Using descriptive names **helps programmers understand** the purpose of the code more easily and improves code readability.
8. Use uppercase letters for constants: Constants (**values that shouldn’t change**) are usually written in all caps, e.g., `PI`, `MASS`, `TEMP`.

For identifiers that consist of multiple words, you have a couple of common options:
1. **Using underscores (snake_case)**: Words are separated by underscores.

   ```python
      this_is_a_long_variable = 50
   ```
   
2. **Using camelCase:**

   ```python
      camelCaseExample = 50
   ```

**Tips for identifiers:**

* Choose names that **clearly describe** the variable, function, or class.
* **Avoid single letters** except for simple counters or loops.
* **Stick to one naming convention** consistently in your code.

## Lines in Python
In Python, there are two important concepts related to lines of code: **physical lines and logical lines**.

1. **Physical line**: A physical line is what you can **see visually in your code**. **Each line** you write in the editor is a physical line.

   ```python
      x = 50
      y = 20
      z = x + y 
   ```

2. **Logical line**: A logical line is what the **interpreter considers as a single instruction**. Sometimes, a logical line can span multiple physical lines. You can separate multiple statements on a single physical line using a **semicolon** `;`. Even though it looks like one line, the interpreter treats each statement separately.

   ```python
      a = 5; b = 10; c = a + b
   ```
  To write a single logical line across multiple physical lines, you can use the backslash \ at the end of a line. Here, the code spans two physical lines but is treated as **one logical line**.

  ```python
      total = a + b + c + \
              d + e + f
   ```

Using **proper indentation and line continuation** makes code more readable and easier to maintain.
  
## Indentation in Python
In many programming languages such as** C++, C, and Java**, curly braces `{}` are used to define a block of code.

In Python, **indentation is used** instead to define blocks. 
* Indentation refers to the **spaces** or **tabs** at the **beginning of a physical line**.
* A block of code such as the **body of a function, loop, or conditional statement** starts with an indented line and **ends when a line with no indentation** appears.
* The amount of indentation is **up to the programmer**, but **consistency is required**: all lines within the same block must have the same level of indentation.
* In general, **using four spaces** for indentation is preferred over using tabs.
* Following these **standards and widely accepted** conventions among programmers worldwide **improves code readability**.
* Proper indentation in Python ensures that the code is **organized, clear, and easy to understand**.

  ```python
     if True:
        print("This is indented")  # Start of a block
        x = 10                     # Same block
     print("No indentation, block ends")  # End of block
  ```

## Statements in Python
In Python, statements can be broadly classified into **two categories**: **simple statements** and **compound statements**.

1. **Simple Statements**:  Simple statements are executed independently and can be written on a single physical or logical line. These statements perform a single action and do not contain other statements inside them. Examples of simple statements:
   * Function calls: `print("Hello")`
   * Import statements: `import math`
   * Variable assignments: `x = 5`
   * Mathematical operations: `y = x + 10`

2. **Compound Statements**: Compound statements **control the execution of other statements** or affect their flow.
   * A compound statement consists of **one or more clauses**.
   * Each clause has a **header** and a **suite**:
     * The header **starts with a unique keyword and ends with a colon `:`**.
     * The suite is a block of **indented statements** that follow the header. Indentation in the suite is **mandatory** in Python.
     * Examples of compound statements:
       * Conditional statements: `if, elif, else`
       * Function definitions: `def`
       * Loops: `for, while`

```python
   Simple Statement:
   -----------------
   x = 10             # Assignment
   print(x)           # Function call
   import math        # Import statement
   y = x + 5          # Mathematical operation
   
   ----------------------------------------
   
   Compound Statement:
   -------------------
   if x > 0:          # Header (ends with :)
       print("Positive")  # Suite (indented block)
       y = x + 5          # Another statement in the suite
   
   for i in range(3):    # Header
       print(i)          # Suite
       x += i
   
   def greet(name):      # Header (function definition)
       print(f"Hello, {name}")  # Suite
```

## Variables in Python
Variables in Python are **like containers that store data**, which can be modified later through programming. A variable is a named location in memory used to store data. You can **assign a value** to a variable using the `=` operator:

```python
   x = 10
   name = "Daniel"
```
### Key Features of Python Variables:
1. **No need to declare a type:**
   Unlike languages such as **C, C++, or Java**, you don’t need to declare a variable type in Python. Python **automatically infers** the type of a variable **based on the assigned value**.

2. **Type can change:**
   During program execution, both the value and the type of a variable can change:

   ```python
      x = 10      # x is an integer
      x = "Hello" # now x is a string
   ```

3. **Variables store references, not values:**
   In Python, **variables do not directly store values**. Instead, they **hold a reference (link) to an object in memory**.

   ```python
      a = 10  # Creates an integer object 10 and links a to it
      a = 20  # Now a refers to the integer object 20
      b = a   # b also refers to the object 20
   ```

### Multiple Assignment in Python
Python allows you to assign values to **multiple variables in a single line**. This is called multiple assignment. Multiple assignment improves readability and reduces the number of lines needed for variable initialization. 

1. **Assign the same value to multiple variables:**
   
   ```python
      a = b = c = 10
   ```

    * Here, `a`, `b`, and `c` all **reference the same value** `10`.
    * Any of the variables can be used independently, but initially, they all hold the same object.

2. **Assign different values to multiple variables**

   ```python
      a, b, name = 10, 20, "Majid Arasteh"
   ```

   * Here, **a gets 10, b gets 20, and name gets Majid Arasteh**.
   * This is a convenient way to initialize multiple variables in one line.

3. **Swapping variables using multiple assignment**

   ```python
      a, b = b, a
   ```
   * This swaps the values of `a` and `b` **without needing a temporary variable**.

## Operators in Python
**Operators** are special symbols in Python that perform arithmetic or logical operations.

### Arithmetic Operators
**Arithmetic Operators** are used to perform **mathematical calculations** such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and more.

| Operator | Meaning             | Example  | Result |
| -------- | ------------------- | -------- | ------ |
| `+`      | Addition            | `5 + 3`  | `8`    |
| `-`      | Subtraction         | `10 - 4` | `6`    |
| `*`      | Multiplication      | `6 * 7`  | `42`   |
| `/`      | Division (float)    | `8 / 2`  | `4.0`  |
| `//`     | Floor division      | `7 // 2` | `3`    |
| `%`      | Modulus (remainder) | `9 % 4`  | `1`    |
| `**`     | Exponentiation      | `2 ** 3` | `8`    |

Note:
   * `/` always gives a floating-point result.
   * `//` gives the integer part of the division (floor value).
   * `%` gives the remainder after division.
   * `**` is used for powers, e.g., `2 ** 3 = 2 × 2 × 2 = 8`.

### **Comparison Operators in Python**
Comparison operators are used to **compare values in Python**. Depending on the comparison, the result will be either `True` or `False`.

| Operator | Meaning                  | Example  | Result |
| -------- | ------------------------ | -------- | ------ |
| `==`     | Equal to                 | `5 == 5` | `True` |
| `!=`     | Not equal to             | `5 != 3` | `True` |
| `>`      | Greater than             | `7 > 4`  | `True` |
| `<`      | Less than                | `2 < 5`  | `True` |
| `>=`     | Greater than or equal to | `6 >= 6` | `True` |
| `<=`     | Less than or equal to    | `3 <= 5` | `True` |

**Notes:**
   * The result of a comparison is always a **Boolean**: `True or False`.
   * Comparison operators are often used in `if` **statements** and **loops** to **control the program** flow.

### Logical Operators in Python
* Logical operators are used to **combine or modify Boolean** values (`True` or `False`).
* The **main logical operators** in Python are:
  * `and`
  * `or`
  * `not`

| Operator | Meaning                                            | Example          | Result  |
| -------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ---------------- | ------- |
| `and`    | Returns `True` if **both** values are `True`       | `True and False` | `False` |
| `or`     | Returns `True` if **at least one** value is `True` | `True or False`  | `True`  |
| `not`    | Returns the **opposite** Boolean value             | `not True`       | `False` |

Notes:
* `and` needs **both conditions to be True** to return True.
* `or` **only needs one condition to be True** to return True.
* `not` simply **reverses the Boolean value**.

Here’s a clear **truth table** for `and`, `or`, and `not` with two variables `A` and `B`:

| A     | B     | A and B | A or B | not A | not B |
| ----- | ----- | ------- | ------ | ----- | ----- |
| True  | True  | True    | True   | False | False |
| True  | False | False   | True   | False | True  |
| False | True  | False   | True   | True  | False |
| False | False | False   | False  | True  | True  |


### Combined Assignment Operators in Python
* These are a **combination of an arithmetic operator and the assignment operator** `=`.
* They allow you to update the value of a variable in a **shorter form** instead of writing the full expression.

```python
   x = 5      # normal assignment
   x += 3     # equivalent to x = x + 3
   print(x)   # output: 8
   
   y = 10
   y *= 2     # equivalent to y = y * 2
   print(y)   # output: 20
```

* Other combined assignment operators include: `-=, /=, //=, %=, **=`.
* Here’s a table of combined assignment operators in Python with examples:

| Operator | Meaning                   | Example   | Equivalent To | Result      |
| -------- | ------------------------- | --------- | ------------- | ----------- |
| `+=`     | Add and assign            | `x += 3`  | `x = x + 3`   | Updates `x` |
| `-=`     | Subtract and assign       | `x -= 2`  | `x = x - 2`   | Updates `x` |
| `*=`     | Multiply and assign       | `x *= 4`  | `x = x * 4`   | Updates `x` |
| `/=`     | Divide and assign (float) | `x /= 5`  | `x = x / 5`   | Updates `x` |
| `//=`    | Floor divide and assign   | `x //= 2` | `x = x // 2`  | Updates `x` |
| `%=`     | Modulus and assign        | `x %= 3`  | `x = x % 3`   | Updates `x` |
| `**=`    | Exponentiation and assign | `x **= 2` | `x = x ** 2`  | Updates `x` |
