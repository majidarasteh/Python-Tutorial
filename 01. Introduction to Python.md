9. **Internet of Things (IoT)**:
Python is used in IoT devices and embedded systems, enabling developers to control sensors, devices, and connected systems.

# Learning the Python Programming Language
Just like any human language such as Persian or English, Python also **uses symbols**, including **letters (a–z)**, **digits**, and** characters like `{}, (), /`, and others.

In the same way that every language has its own vocabulary (for example, “water,” “father,” etc.), **Python also has its own set of keywords**, such as **if, else, while**, and many more.

Just as human languages have grammar rules that define how words come together to form meaningful sentences (such as the placement of subject, verb, and object), **programming languages also have their own structural rules**. These rules determine how code must be written so the computer can understand and execute it correctly.

## Keywords in Python
Keywords are words that cannot be used as identifiers, such as **variable names** or **function names**. In Python, **keywords are case-sensitive**. For example, Variable and variable are not the same. This means you cannot write a keyword in uppercase if it is defined in lowercase, or vice versa; doing so will cause an error in your program.

**Python has 35 keywords**, although this number may change gradually over time. In Python, **all keywords are written in lowercase, except for False, True, and None**. They must be written exactly as they are.

```python
import keyword
print(keyword.kwlist)

False      await      else       import     pass
None       break      except     in         raise
True       class      finally    is         return
and        continue   for        lambda     try
as         def        from       nonlocal   while
assert     del        global     not        with
async      elif       if         or         yield

```

## Identifiers in Python
Identifiers are **names used** to identify **variables**, **functions**, **classes**, **or other** objects in Python.

1. An identifier can be a **combination of uppercase and lowercase letters and numbers**.
2. Examples of valid identifiers:
   
   ```python
      myVar1
      X2
      my_file_0
   ```

3. An identifier **cannot start with a number**. For example:

   ```python
      1variable  # ❌ Invalid
      variable1  # ✅ Valid
   ```

4. Keywords cannot be used as identifiers. For example:

   ```python
      else = 1  # ❌ Invalid
   ```

5. Special symbols such as `!, @, #, $, %`, and others **cannot be used in identifiers**.
6. Identifiers are **case-sensitive**, so `myVar` and `myvar` are **considered different**.
7. When choosing identifiers, it’s important to **pick meaningful names**. While `c = 10` is valid, writing `count = 10` is more meaningful and clearly shows what the variable represents. Using descriptive names **helps programmers understand** the purpose of the code more easily and improves code readability.

For identifiers that consist of multiple words, you have a couple of common options:
1. **Using underscores (snake_case)**: Words are separated by underscores.

   ```python
      this_is_a_long_variable = 50
   ```
   
2. **Using camelCase:**

   ```python
      camelCaseExample = 50
   ```

**Tips for identifiers:**

* Choose names that **clearly describe** the variable, function, or class.
* **Avoid single letters** except for simple counters or loops.
* **Stick to one naming convention** consistently in your code.

## Lines in Python
In Python, there are two important concepts related to lines of code: **physical lines and logical lines**.

1. **Physical line**: A physical line is what you can **see visually in your code**. **Each line** you write in the editor is a physical line.

   ```python
      x = 50
      y = 20
      z = x + y 
   ```

2. **Logical line**: A logical line is what the **interpreter considers as a single instruction**. Sometimes, a logical line can span multiple physical lines. You can separate multiple statements on a single physical line using a **semicolon** `;`. Even though it looks like one line, the interpreter treats each statement separately.

   ```python
      a = 5; b = 10; c = a + b
   ```
  To write a single logical line across multiple physical lines, you can use the backslash \ at the end of a line. Here, the code spans two physical lines but is treated as **one logical line**.

  ```python
      total = a + b + c + \
              d + e + f
   ```

Using **proper indentation and line continuation** makes code more readable and easier to maintain.
  
## Indentation in Python
In many programming languages such as** C++, C, and Java**, curly braces `{}` are used to define a block of code.

In Python, **indentation is used** instead to define blocks. 
* Indentation refers to the **spaces** or **tabs** at the **beginning of a physical line**.
* A block of code such as the **body of a function, loop, or conditional statement** starts with an indented line and **ends when a line with no indentation** appears.
* The amount of indentation is **up to the programmer**, but **consistency is required**: all lines within the same block must have the same level of indentation.
* In general, **using four spaces** for indentation is preferred over using tabs.
* Following these **standards and widely accepted** conventions among programmers worldwide **improves code readability**.
* Proper indentation in Python ensures that the code is **organized, clear, and easy to understand**.

  ```python
     if True:
        print("This is indented")  # Start of a block
        x = 10                     # Same block
     print("No indentation, block ends")  # End of block
  ```

## Statements in Python
In Python, statements can be broadly classified into **two categories**: **simple statements** and **compound statements**.

1. **Simple Statements**:  Simple statements are executed independently and can be written on a single physical or logical line. These statements perform a single action and do not contain other statements inside them. Examples of simple statements:
   * Function calls: `print("Hello")`
   * Import statements: `import math`
   * Variable assignments: `x = 5`
   * Mathematical operations: `y = x + 10`

2. **Compound Statements**: Compound statements **control the execution of other statements** or affect their flow.
   * A compound statement consists of **one or more clauses**.
   * Each clause has a **header** and a **suite**:
     * The header **starts with a unique keyword and ends with a colon `:`**.
     * The suite is a block of **indented statements** that follow the header. Indentation in the suite is **mandatory** in Python.
     * Examples of compound statements:
       * Conditional statements: `if, elif, else`
       * Function definitions: `def`
       * Loops: `for, while`

```python
   Simple Statement:
   -----------------
   x = 10             # Assignment
   print(x)           # Function call
   import math        # Import statement
   y = x + 5          # Mathematical operation
   
   ----------------------------------------
   
   Compound Statement:
   -------------------
   if x > 0:          # Header (ends with :)
       print("Positive")  # Suite (indented block)
       y = x + 5          # Another statement in the suite
   
   for i in range(3):    # Header
       print(i)          # Suite
       x += i
   
   def greet(name):      # Header (function definition)
       print(f"Hello, {name}")  # Suite
```
