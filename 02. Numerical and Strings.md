# Numerical Data Types
In Python, **numerical data types** are used to **store numbers**. Python has three main numerical types:
1. **Integer (`int`)**
   * Stores whole numbers (positive, negative, or zero).
   * Examples:
  
     ```python
        x = 10
        y = -5
        z = 0
     ```
2. **Float (`float`)**
   * Stores **decimal numbers** (numbers with a fractional part).
   * Examples:
  
     ```python
        pi = 3.14
        temperature = -0.5
        height = 2.0
     ```

    * Scientific Notation
      * e or E means "× 10 to the power of".
      * $6e8 → 6×10^8 → 600000000.0$
      * $6e-8 → 6×10^{-8} → 0.00000006$

  3. **Complex (`complex`)**
     * Stores complex numbers with a **real part** and an **imaginary part**.
     * Imaginary part is denoted with a  `j`.
     * Examples:

       ```python
          a = 2 + 3j
          b = 1 - 4j
       ```

**Note: Use int for counting, float for measurements, and complex for mathematical computations involving complex numbers.**

## Decimal Numbers in Python
* Decimal numbers are numbers that have a **fractional part**, i.e., numbers with digits after the decimal point.
* In Python, they are usually **represented** by the `float` data type.
* Example of decimal numbers:

  ```python
    x = 3.14
    y = -0.5
    z = 2.0
  ```
  
**Important Points**
1. **Float Type**
   * Decimal numbers in Python are `float` by default.
   * They can be positive or negative.
   * Even a whole number with a decimal point (e.g., `2.0`) is **considered a float**.
     
2. **Scientific Notation**: You can also write decimal numbers in scientific notation:
   
   ```python
      a = 6e-8   # 6 × 10^-8 → 0.00000006
      b = 1.23e4 # 1.23 × 10^4 → 12300.0
   ```

3. **Precision**
   * Float numbers have **limited precision**.
   * For very **precise decimal calculations** (like financial calculations), you can use the **decimal module**:
  
     ```python
        from decimal import Decimal

        price = Decimal('19.99')
        tax = Decimal('0.07')
        total = price + price * tax
        print(total)  # 21.3893
     ```

      | Type      | Example          | Description                     |
      | --------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------- |
      | `float`   | 3.14, -0.5, 2.0  | Decimal numbers (with fraction) |
      | `Decimal` | Decimal('19.99') | High-precision decimal numbers  |

    * Due to the way floating-point numbers are represented in binary within computer systems, decimal values like 0.1 and 0.2 cannot be stored with perfect accuracy. When you define these numbers as floats in Python, they are often stored as approximations, such as 0.10000000000000000555 or 0.20000000000000001110. This inherent imprecision can lead to unexpected results in calculations—for instance, (0.1 + 0.2 == 0.3) surprisingly evaluates to False. This is a common source of logical errors in programs that require high precision for financial or scientific computations.
   
## Fraction Data Type
* Python has a Fraction data type in the fractions module to represent rational numbers (numbers as a ratio of two integers).
* A fraction is represented as **numerator/denominator**.
* It allows exact arithmetic with **fractions instead of floating-point approximations**.

  ```python
    from fractions import Fraction
    
    # Create fractions
    a = Fraction(3, 4)    # 3/4
    b = Fraction(5, 6)    # 5/6
    
    # Arithmetic with fractions
    print(a + b)           # 19/12
    print(a - b)           # -1/12
    print(a * b)           # 5/8
    print(a / b)           # 9/10
    
    # Fraction from float or string
    c = Fraction(0.75)     # 3/4
    d = Fraction("0.6")    # 3/5
  ```

* Fractions maintain exact values:

  ```python
     Fraction(1, 3) + Fraction(1, 3)  # 2/3
  ```
  
* Fractions can be converted to float if needed:

  ```python
     float(Fraction(3, 4))  # 0.75
  ```
  
* Useful for precise arithmetic, like in mathematics, engineering, or finance, where floating-point rounding errors are undesirable.

## Binary, Octal, and Hexadecimal Numbers in Python
1. **Binary Numbers**
   * Binary numbers use **base 2**, consisting of digits `0` and `1`.
   * In Python, **binary literals start with** `0b` or `0B`.

     ```python
        x = 0b1010  # binary for 10
        print(x)    # Output: 10
     ```
2. **Octal Numbers**:
   * Octal numbers use **base 8**, consisting of digits `0` to `7`.
   * In Python, octal **literals start with** `0o` or `0O`.
  
     ```python
        y = 0o12   # octal for 10
        print(y)   # Output: 10
     ```
3. **Hexadecimal Numbers**:
   * Hexadecimal numbers use **base 16**, consisting of **digits** `0-9` and **letters** `A-F` **(or a-f) for values 10-15**.
   * In Python, **hexadecimal literals start with** `0x` or `0X`.

     ```python
        z = 0xA    # hexadecimal for 10
        print(z)   # Output: 10
     ```

    | Number System | Base | Digits   | Python Prefix | Example  | Decimal Value |
    | ------------- | ---- | -------- | ------------- | -------- | ------------- |
    | Binary        | 2    | 0,1      | `0b` / `0B`   | `0b1010` | 10            |
    | Octal         | 8    | 0-7      | `0o` / `0O`   | `0o12`   | 10            |
    | Hexadecimal   | 16   | 0-9, A-F | `0x` / `0X`   | `0xA`    | 10            |

**You can convert between these formats and decimal using Python built-in functions:**

```python
bin(10)   # '0b1010'
oct(10)   # '0o12'
hex(10)   # '0xa'
```

# Strings in Python
* A string is a **sequence of characters** enclosed in single quotes `'...'` or double quotes `"..."`.
* Strings can contain **letters, numbers, symbols, or even spaces**.

  ```python
  name = "Ali"
  password = 'jf38jkwld213'
  ```

* **Docstrings**: A docstring (documentation string) is a special type of string used to document functions, classes, and modules in Python.
Docstrings are written using three double quotes:

  ```python
      string = """Hello,
      I
      Hope
      you are
      doinq well. """
      print(string)
  ```

* **Example: Docstring in a Function**

  ```python
    def add(a, b):
        """
        This function takes two numbers (a and b)
        and returns their sum.
        """
        return a + b
  ```

* When a string's content needs to include a quotation mark or an apostrophe, it must be preceded by a backslash (`\`). This is known as escaping the character. For example: name = `"I\'m Majid"`.
* In Python, **unlike** many other programming languages, **there is no distinct 'character' data type**. A single character is simply treated as a string with a length of one.

### Encoding
* **Converts characters into numbers** so that computers can store or transmit text.
* Example: **'A' → 65 in ASCII**
* In Python: `ord()` **gives the numeric code of a character**

```python
   print(ord('A'))  # Output: 65
```

### Decoding
* **Converts numbers back into characters**.
* In Python: `chr()` gives the character from its numeric code

```python
   print(chr(65))   # Output: 'A'
```

### Character Encoding Standards
1. **ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange)**
   * **Uses 7 bits** to represent **128 characters**.
   * Includes English letters, digits, punctuation, and control characters.
   * **Examples**:
     * 'A' → 65
     * 'a' → 97
     * '0' → 48
       
2. **Unicode (UNI code)**
   * Can **represent all characters from all languages**.
   * Python strings are Unicode by default.
   * **Unicode covers ASCII** and also characters like ب, 你, 😊.
  
     ```python
        print(ord('ب'))  # 1576
        print(ord('😊')) # 128522
     ```

| Function / Concept | Description                      | Example       | Output      |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------- | ------------- | ----------- |
| `ord()`            | Character → ASCII / Unicode code | `ord('A')`    | 65          |
| `chr()`            | ASCII / Unicode code → Character | `chr(65)`     | 'A'         |
| ASCII              | Standard 128 characters          | 'A', 'a', '0' | 65,97,48    |
| Unicode            | Supports all characters globally | 'अ', '😊'     | 2309,128522 |
