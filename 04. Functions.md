# Function

A **function** in Python is a group of related statements that perform a specific task. Functions help break down a program into smaller, **modular sections**. As a program grows larger and more complex, functions make it more organized and **manageable**. Furthermore, functions **prevent code repetition** for a single task and make the code **reusable**. Advantages of function are as follow:

1. **Organization and Manageability**: Instead of a long script, your code becomes a **collection of small, understandable functions**. Each function has a name that describes what it does (e.g., calculate_total, validate_results, print_report). This makes the program's logic much **easier to follow, debug, and modify**. As your project grows, this structure becomes indispensable.
  
2. **Elimination of Repetition (DRY Principle)**: The DRY principle stands for "**Don't Repeat Yourself**." If you find yourself writing the same code in multiple places, that's a sign you need a function. You **write the code once inside the function**, and **then you can call that function from anywhere in your program** whenever you need that task performed. This **not only saves time but also prevents errors**. If you need to **change the logic**, you only have to update it in one place.
   
3. **Reusability**: **Once a function is written and tested, it becomes a reusable building block**. You can use it in the **same program**, or even copy it into an entirely **different project**, **saving development time and effort**. This is why **Python has a rich ecosystem of libraries and modules** they are essentially collections of pre-written, reusable functions.

4. **Abstraction**: A function allows you to use **code without needing to understand its internal complexities**. For example, you can use Python's built-in **`sort()`** function without knowing which sorting algorithm it uses. **You only need to know what data to give it (the input) and what result to expect back (the output)**. This allows you to build **complex programs by combining simpler, abstracted parts**.

Python has **two types of functions**:
1. Built-in Functions
2. User-Defined Functions

## Built-in Functions
These are functions that come **predefined in Python**, ready for you to use without writing any additional code. Examples of common built-in functions:

| Function  | Description                  | Example                        |
| --------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| `print()` | Displays output              | `print("Hello")`               |
| `len()`   | Gives length of a sequence   | `len("Python")`                |
| `type()`  | Shows the type of a variable | `type(5)`                      |
| `int()`   | Converts to integer          | `int("10")`                    |
| `str()`   | Converts to string           | `str(123)`                     |
| `float()` | Converts to float            | `float("3.14")`                |
| `input()` | Takes input from user        | `name = input("Enter name: ")` |
| `max()`   | Returns the largest value    | `max(2, 5, 1)`                 |
| `min()`   | Returns the smallest value   | `min(2, 5, 1)`                 |


**Example**

```python
   x = len([10, 20, 30])
   print(x)   # Output: 3
```

## User-Defined Functions
These are functions that **you create yourself** to perform a specific task.

**Syntax**

```python
    def function_name(parameters):
        # code block
        return value
```

**Simple Example**

```python
    def greet():
        print("Hello, welcome to Python!")
```

**Calling the function:**

```python
    greet()
    # Output: Hello, welcome to Python!
```

### Functions with Parameters
You can pass values to functions using parameters.

**Example**

```python
   def add(a, b):
       return a + b
    
   result = add(5, 3)
   print(result)       # Output: 8
```

### Functions with Default Parameters
You can set default values for parameters.

**Example**

```python
   def greet(name="User"):
      print("Hello,", name)
  
   greet()         # uses default
   greet("Majid")  # overrides default
```

**Output**

```
Hello, User
Hello, Majid
```
