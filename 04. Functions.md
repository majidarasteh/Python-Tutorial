# Function

A **function** in Python is a group of related statements that perform a specific task. Functions help break down a program into smaller, **modular sections**. As a program grows larger and more complex, functions make it more organized and **manageable**. Furthermore, functions **prevent code repetition** for a single task and make the code **reusable**. Advantages of function are as follow:

1. **Organization and Manageability**: Instead of a long script, your code becomes a **collection of small, understandable functions**. Each function has a name that describes what it does (e.g., calculate_total, validate_results, print_report). This makes the program's logic much **easier to follow, debug, and modify**. As your project grows, this structure becomes indispensable.
  
2. **Elimination of Repetition (DRY Principle)**: The DRY principle stands for "**Don't Repeat Yourself**." If you find yourself writing the same code in multiple places, that's a sign you need a function. You **write the code once inside the function**, and **then you can call that function from anywhere in your program** whenever you need that task performed. This **not only saves time but also prevents errors**. If you need to **change the logic**, you only have to update it in one place.
   
3. **Reusability**: **Once a function is written and tested, it becomes a reusable building block**. You can use it in the **same program**, or even copy it into an entirely **different project**, **saving development time and effort**. This is why **Python has a rich ecosystem of libraries and modules** they are essentially collections of pre-written, reusable functions.

4. **Abstraction**: A function allows you to use **code without needing to understand its internal complexities**. For example, you can use Python's built-in **`sort()`** function without knowing which sorting algorithm it uses. **You only need to know what data to give it (the input) and what result to expect back (the output)**. This allows you to build **complex programs by combining simpler, abstracted parts**.

Python has **two types of functions**:
1. Built-in Functions
2. User-Defined Functions

## Built-in Functions
These are functions that come **predefined in Python**, ready for you to use without writing any additional code. Examples of common built-in functions:

| Function  | Description                  | Example                        |
| --------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| `print()` | Displays output              | `print("Hello")`               |
| `len()`   | Gives length of a sequence   | `len("Python")`                |
| `type()`  | Shows the type of a variable | `type(5)`                      |
| `int()`   | Converts to integer          | `int("10")`                    |
| `str()`   | Converts to string           | `str(123)`                     |
| `float()` | Converts to float            | `float("3.14")`                |
| `input()` | Takes input from user        | `name = input("Enter name: ")` |
| `max()`   | Returns the largest value    | `max(2, 5, 1)`                 |
| `min()`   | Returns the smallest value   | `min(2, 5, 1)`                 |


**Example**

```python
   x = len([10, 20, 30])
   print(x)   # Output: 3
```

## User-Defined Functions
These are functions that **you create yourself** to perform a specific task. Python function is defined by the following rules:
1. The `def` keyword is the marker that begins a function's header.
2. Then define function name (`function_name`), which must **uniquely identify the function**.
3. The naming of functions in Python follows the same rules as those for **naming identifiers**.

**docstring**
1. An **optional docstring** (documentation string) is used to **describe what the function does**.
2. Although using a docstring is optional, **documentation is considered a crucial practice** in programming.
3. The docstring is enclosed within triple quotes (`'''` or `"""`).

**Body of a function**
1. **One or more Python statements** form the body of the function.
2. The statements must all be at the **same indentation level** (**typically 4 spaces**).
3. An **optional return statement** is used to **send a value back** from the function.

**The values a Python function returns:**
1. It may return **no value**.
2. It may return a **single value**.
3. It may return **multiple values**.

**Syntax**

```python
    """ Your docstring. """
    def function_name(parameters):
        # code block
        return value
```

**Simple Example**

```python
    """ This function is a simple greeting function. """
    def greet():
        print("Hello, welcome to Python!")
```

**Calling the function:**
1. After a function is defined, it can be called from within another function, the main program, or even the Python command prompt.
2. To call a function in Python, you simply write its name followed by the appropriate parameters: `function_name(parameters)`
3. The number of arguments in the function call must match the number of parameters in the function's definition.
4. Python also allows a function to be called from within another function.

```python
    greet()
    # Output: Hello, welcome to Python!
```

### Functions with Parameters
You can pass values to functions using parameters.
1. Parameters (or arguments) are used to **pass values into a function**. They are optional.
2. Function parameters are separated from each other by commas (`,`).
3. When the function is called, values for these parameters must be provided to it.
4. A colon (`:`) marks the end of the function header.

**Example**

```python
   def add(a, b):
       return a + b
    
   result = add(5, 3)
   print(result)       # Output: 8
```

### Functions with Default Parameters
You can set default values for parameters.

**Example**

```python
   def greet(name="User"):
      print("Hello,", name)
  
   greet()         # uses default
   greet("Majid")  # overrides default
```

**Output**

```
Hello, User
Hello, Majid
```

### Functions Returning Multiple Values
Python can return more than one value using tuples.

**Example**

```python
   def calculate(a, b):
       return a + b, a * b

   sum_result, mul_result = calculate(3, 4)
   print(sum_result, mul_result)             # Output 7 12
```

The general structure of functions are as follow:
