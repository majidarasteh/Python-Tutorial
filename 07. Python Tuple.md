# **Python Tuple**

A **tuple** is an **immutable sequence** of elements, similar to a list. Once created, its elements **cannot be changed, added, or removed**. Tuples can store **any data type**, including numbers, strings, lists, or even other tuples, and are **defined using parentheses `()`**. They are useful for **read-only data**, **dictionary keys**, and **efficient iteration**, since their immutability can improve performance.


---

## **1. What is a Tuple?**

**Description:** A tuple is an **immutable sequence** of elements. Use parentheses `()` to create it.
**Example (Supposed Tuple):**

```python
my_tuple = (10, 20, 30)
print(my_tuple)
```

**Output:**

```python
(10, 20, 30)
```

---

## **2. Single-Element Tuples**

**Description:** To create a tuple with **one element**, include a **comma** after it.
**Example (Supposed Tuple):**

```python
my_tuple = ("hello",)
print(type(my_tuple))
```

**Output:**

```python
<class 'tuple'>
```

---

## **3. Accessing Tuple Elements**

**Description:** Use **indices** to access elements; supports **nested tuples**.
**Example (Supposed Tuple):**

```python
my_tuple = ('a','b','c')
print(my_tuple[1])
```

**Output:**

```python
'b'
```

**Nested Example (Supposed Tuple):**

```python
n_tuple = ("dog", [1, 2, 3], (4, 5))
print(n_tuple[0][1])
print(n_tuple[1][2])
```

**Output:**

```python
'o'
3
```

---

## **4. Slicing a Tuple**

**Description:** Use **`:`** to extract a range of elements.
**Example (Supposed Tuple):**

```python
my_tuple = ('x','y','z','p','q','r')
print(my_tuple[1:4])
print(my_tuple[:-3])
print(my_tuple[3:])
print(my_tuple[:])
```

**Output:**

```python
('y','z','p')
('x','y','z')
('p','q','r')
('x','y','z','p','q','r')
```

---

## **5. Changing a Tuple**

**Description:** Tuples are immutable, but **nested mutable elements** can be modified. Tuples can also be reassigned.
**Example (Supposed Tuple):**

```python
my_tuple = (1, 2, [3,4])
my_tuple[2][0] = 9
print(my_tuple)
```

**Output:**

```python
(1, 2, [9, 4])
```

**Reassigning Tuple (Supposed Tuple):**

```python
my_tuple = ('p','y','t','h','o','n')
print(my_tuple)
```

**Output:**

```python
('p','y','t','h','o','n')
```

## **6. Tuple Methods and Operators**

**Description:** Tuples have **limited methods** due to immutability. Common operations include counting, indexing, membership, and numeric functions.

---

### **6.1 Concatenation (`+`)**

**Description:** Combines two tuples into a new tuple.
**Supposed Tuple:**

```python
tuple1 = (1, 2, 3)
tuple2 = (4, 5)
new_tuple = tuple1 + tuple2
print(new_tuple)
```

**Output:**

```python
(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
```

### **6.2 Repetition (`*`)**

**Description:** Repeats a tuple multiple times.
**Supposed Tuple:**

```python
my_tuple = (7, 8)
print(my_tuple * 3)
```

**Output:**

```python
(7, 8, 7, 8, 7, 8)
```

### **6.3 Count (`count(x)`)**

**Description:** Returns number of occurrences of `x`.
**Supposed Tuple:**

```python
my_tuple = (1, 2, 2, 3, 2)
print(my_tuple.count(2))
```

**Output:**

```python
3
```

### **6.4 Index (`index(x)`)**

**Description:** Returns the **first index** of `x`.
**Supposed Tuple:**

```python
my_tuple = ('a','b','c','b')
print(my_tuple.index('b'))
```

**Output:**

```python
1
```

### **6.5 Membership (`in`, `not in`)**

**Description:** Checks if an element exists or does not exist in the tuple.
**Supposed Tuple:**

```python
my_tuple = (10, 20, 30)
print(20 in my_tuple)
print(40 not in my_tuple)
```

**Output:**

```python
True
True
```

### **6.6 Convert to Tuple (`tuple()`)**

**Description:** Converts iterable (list, string) to a tuple.
**Supposed Tuple:**

```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3]
my_string = "abc"
print(tuple(my_list))
print(tuple(my_string))
```

**Output:**

```python
(1, 2, 3)
('a', 'b', 'c')
```

### **6.7 Length (`len()`)**

**Description:** Returns number of elements.
**Supposed Tuple:**

```python
my_tuple = (5, 6, 7, 8)
print(len(my_tuple))
```

**Output:**

```python
4
```

### **6.8 All / Any (`all()`, `any()`)**

**Description:** `all()` → True if all elements are true; `any()` → True if at least one element is true.
**Supposed Tuple:**

```python
t1 = (1, 2, 3)
t2 = (0, 1, 2)
print(all(t1))
print(all(t2))
print(any(t1))
print(any(t2))
```

**Output:**

```python
True
False
True
True
```

### **6.9 Enumerate (`enumerate()`)**

**Description:** Returns **index-value pairs**.
**Supposed Tuple:**

```python
my_tuple = ('apple','banana','cherry')
for index, value in enumerate(my_tuple):
    print(index, value)
```

**Output:**

```python
0 apple
1 banana
2 cherry
```

### **6.10 Max, Min, Sum**

**Description:** Returns largest, smallest, or sum of numeric elements.
**Supposed Tuple:**

```python
my_tuple = (10, 5, 8)
print(max(my_tuple))
print(min(my_tuple))
print(sum(my_tuple))
```

**Output:**

10
5
23

my_tuple = (3, 1, 4, 2)
print(sorted(my_tuple))
```

**Output:**

```python
[1, 2, 3, 4]
```

---

## **7. Comparing Tuples**

**Description:** Use `==` or `!=` to compare tuples element-wise.
**Supposed Tuple:**

```python
tuple1 = (1,2,3)
tuple2 = (1,2,3)
tuple3 = (4,5,6)
print(tuple1 == tuple2)
print(tuple1 != tuple3)
```

**Output:**

```python
True
True
```

---

## **8. For Loop in Tuples**

**Description:** Iterate through each element.
**Supposed Tuple:**

```python
numbers = (2, 4, 6)
for num in numbers:
    print(num)
```

**Output:**

```python
2
4
6
```

**Doubling Elements (Supposed Tuple):**

```python
new_tuple = ()
for number in (1,3,5):
    new_tuple += (number*2,)
print(new_tuple)
```

**Output:**

```python
(2,6,10)
```

---

## **9. Appending to a Tuple (Workaround)**

**Description:** Tuples are immutable; append by creating a **new tuple** or converting to a list.

**New Tuple (Supposed Tuple):**

```python
my_tuple = (1,2,3)
my_tuple = my_tuple + (4,)
print(my_tuple)
```

**Output:**

```python
(1,2,3,4)
```

**Using List (Supposed Tuple):**

```python
temp = list((1,2,3))
temp.append(5)
my_tuple = tuple(temp)
print(my_tuple)
```

**Output:**

```python
(1,2,3,5)
```
