# Conditional Statements in Python (if, elif, else)
Python needs to **make decisions** while running a program. To do this, Python uses conditional statements.

1. **The `if` Statement**:

   `if` is used when you want the program to run some code only if a condition is true.

   **Syntax**

   ```python
      if condition:
          # code to run when condition is True
   ```

   **Example**: `If` the condition **age >= 18** is `True`, Python executes the code inside the if block.

   ```python
      age = 20

      if age >= 18:
          print("You are an adult.")
   ```

2. **The `elif` Statement**:

   It is used when you want to check **multiple conditions one after another**.

   **Syntax**

   ```python
      if condition1:
        # code block 1
      elif condition2:
        # code block 2
   ```

   **Example**: Python checks **conditions from top to bottom** and **stops at the first True** condition.

   ```python
      score = 80

      if score >= 90:
          print("Grade: A")
      elif score >= 80:
          print("Grade: B")
      elif score >= 70:
          print("Grade: C")
   ```

3. **The `else` Statement**:

   `else` is used when **none of the previous** conditions are true.

      **Syntax**

      ```python
      if condition1:
          ...
      elif condition2:
          ...
      else:
          # code when all above conditions are False
      ```

      **First Example** Here, since `temperature = 10` doesn't match the first two conditions, Python executes the `else` block.

      ```python
          temperature = 10
    
          if temperature > 30:
              print("It's hot!")
          elif temperature >= 15:
              print("The weather is nice.")
          else:
              print("It's cold.")
      ```

      **Second Example**

      ```python
          number = 0

          if number > 0:
              print("Positive number")
          elif number < 0:
              print("Negative number")
          else:
              print("Zero")
      ```

### Python checks the statements in this order:
1. Check the `if` condition
2. If not true, check the first `elif`
3. If still not true, check the next `elif`
4. If none are true, run the `else` block

**Only one block runs.** Flowchart diagram of conditional statements is as follow:
