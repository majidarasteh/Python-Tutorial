# Conditional Statements in Python (if, elif, else)
Python needs to **make decisions** while running a program. To do this, Python uses conditional statements.

1. **The `if` Statement**:

   `if` is used when you want the program to run some code only if a condition is true.

   **Syntax**

   ```python
      if condition:
          # code to run when condition is True
   ```

   **Example**: `If` the condition **age >= 18** is `True`, Python executes the code inside the if block.

   ```python
      age = 20

      if age >= 18:
          print("You are an adult.")
   ```

2. **The `elif` Statement**:

   It is used when you want to check **multiple conditions one after another**.

   **Syntax**

   ```python
      if condition1:
        # code block 1
      elif condition2:
        # code block 2
   ```

   **Example**: Python checks **conditions from top to bottom** and **stops at the first True** condition.

   ```python
      score = 80

      if score >= 90:
          print("Grade: A")
      elif score >= 80:
          print("Grade: B")
      elif score >= 70:
          print("Grade: C")
   ```

3. **The `else` Statement**:

   `else` is used when **none of the previous** conditions are true.

      **Syntax**

      ```python
      if condition1:
          ...
      elif condition2:
          ...
      else:
          # code when all above conditions are False
      ```

      **First Example** Here, since `temperature = 10` doesn't match the first two conditions, Python executes the `else` block.

      ```python
          temperature = 10
    
          if temperature > 30:
              print("It's hot!")
          elif temperature >= 15:
              print("The weather is nice.")
          else:
              print("It's cold.")
      ```

      **Second Example**

      ```python
          number = 0

          if number > 0:
              print("Positive number")
          elif number < 0:
              print("Negative number")
          else:
              print("Zero")
      ```

### Python checks the statements in this order:
1. Check the `if` condition
2. If not true, check the first `elif`
3. If still not true, check the next `elif`
4. If none are true, run the `else` block

**Only one block runs.** Flowchart diagram of conditional statements is as follow:

# Loops in Python

Loops allow us to **repeat a block of code multiple times**. Python provides two main loop types:
1. `for` loop → used when **you know how many times to repeat**
2. `while` loop → used when you want to repeat **until a condition becomes false**

## The `for` Loop

A `for` loop is used to iterate over a sequence such as:
* list
* string
* tuple
* range()

Flowchart of `for` is as follow:

<img width="357" height="387" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ba35841f-ee53-4976-a580-50b98d4605c3" />


**Syntax**

```python
   for item in sequence:
       # code to repeat
```

**Example**

```python
   for i in [1, 2, 3]:
       print(i)
```

## The `range()` Function
`range()` generates numbers. Most common uses:

**Basic format**

```python
   range(stop)
   range(start, stop)
   range(start, stop, step)
```

**Examples**

```python
   for i in range(5):      # 0 → 4
       print(i)
   
   for i in range(2, 6):   # 2 → 5
       print(i)
   
   for i in range(1, 10, 2):  # 1,3,5,7,9
       print(i)
```

## Using `for` and `else` Together
An `else` block in a loop runs **only if the loop finishes** normally (**i.e., no break** inside the loop).

**Example: search in a list**

```python
   numbers = [2, 4, 6, 8]

   for n in numbers:
       if n == 6:
           print("Found")
           break
   else:
       print("Not found")
```

* Since **6 is found**, `break` **stops** the loop → **else does NOT** run.
* **Practice:**: Try changing the list to `[2,4,8,10,12]` and see how else will work.

## Using `for` to Scan Strings
A string is a sequence, so you can loop through its characters.

**Example**

```python
   for ch in "Python":
       print(ch)
```

**Output**

```
P
y
t
h
o
n
```

## The `while` Loop
A `while` loop repeats as long **as the condition is True**. The flowchart of `while` statement is as follow:

<img width="434" height="310" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7727f75b-82b5-45fa-b2fa-f63b1486f6db" />

**Syntax**

```python
   while condition:
        # repeat code
```

**Example**

```python
   x = 3
   while x > 0:
       print(x)
       x -= 1
```

**Output**

```
3
2
1
```

## Using `while` and `else` Together
Just like with `for`, the `else` block runs if the loop ends normally, not by `break`.

**Example**

```python
   i = 1
   while i <= 3:
       print(i)
       i += 1
   else:
       print("Loop finished normally")
```

**output**

```
1
2
3
Loop finished normally
```

**If you add a `break` inside the loop, the `else` block will not run.**

**Example**

```python
   i = 1
   while i <= 3:
       print(i)
       i += 1
       if i==3:
          break;
   else:
       print("Loop finished normally")
```

**output**

```
1
2
```

## The `break` Statement
break immediately stops the loop.

**Example**

```python
   for n in range(10):
       if n == 5:
           break
       print(n)
```

**output**

```
0
1
2
3
4
```

## The `continue` Statement
`continue` skips the current iteration and moves to the next one.

**Example**

```python
   for n in range(6):
       if n == 3:
           continue
       print(n)
```

**Output**: **n = 3** is skipped.

```
0
1
2
4
5
```
